I will create a dedicated page for resetting passwords and configure the "Forgot Password" flow to direct users there.

1. **Create a new page** **`app/[locale]/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx`**

   * This page will handle the link sent to the user's email.

   * It will be responsive and follow the design patterns of the application (using existing UI components).

2. **Create the** **`components/auth/ResetPasswordClient.tsx`** **component**

   * This component will contain the logic to verify the code (`oobCode`) sent by Firebase.

   * It will allow the user to enter a new password and confirm it.

   * I will add translations (Internationalization) for Portuguese and English to ensure the interface is consistent.

3. **Update** **`components/auth/ForgotPasswordClient.tsx`**

   * I will modify the email sending function to explicitly point to this new `reset-password` page instead of the default Firebase page or the generic `create-password` page.

4. **Add translations**

   * I will add the necessary texts to `messages/pt.json` and `messages/en.json` (e.g., "Reset Password", "New Password", "Success", etc.).
