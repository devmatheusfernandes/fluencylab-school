I will fix the JSON structure in `messages/pt.json` to resolve the `MISSING_MESSAGE` error.

The error occurs because `heroCard` is defined at the root level in `pt.json`, but the code expects it to be inside `LandingPage`.

**Plan:**
1.  Modify `messages/pt.json` to move `heroCard` inside the `LandingPage` object.
    *   I will use `SearchReplace` to remove the closing brace of `LandingPage` before `heroCard` and add a new closing brace after `heroCard`.
    *   This will align the structure with `en.json` for the `heroCard` component.

**Note:** `pt.json` contains some duplicate keys (`StudentProfileSurvey`, etc.) and structural inconsistencies compared to `en.json`. I will focus on fixing the reported error first to avoid accidental data loss in the large file, but I recommend a full cleanup of `pt.json` in a future task.
