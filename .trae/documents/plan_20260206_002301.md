I will create a new rule file `i18n-maintenance.md` in `.trae/rules/` to specifically address the safe editing of translation JSON files, complementing the existing `usetranslations-use.md`.

**New Rule Content: `i18n-maintenance.md`**
This file will define strict protocols for the AI (and developers) when modifying `messages/*.json` files.

**Key Sections:**
1.  **Parity Principle**: Enforce that `pt.json` and `en.json` must always have identical key structures.
2.  **Context Verification**: Require reading the surrounding lines before inserting/editing to avoid "blind" edits that break JSON syntax or nesting.
3.  **Root-Level Discipline**: Explicitly forbid nesting major component namespaces inside others (e.g., `LandingPage` containing `StudentProfile`).
4.  **Syntax Safety**: Reminders about trailing commas and closing braces.
5.  **Step-by-Step Edit Protocol**: A checklist for the AI to follow (Read -> Verify Structure -> Edit Primary -> Edit Secondary -> Verify Parity).

**Implementation:**
1.  Create `c:\Users\Mathe\OneDrive\Documentos\Projetos de Programação\Em progresso\fluencylab-school\.trae\rules\i18n-maintenance.md` with the content described above.
