# Implement "Learned Items" Modal Feature

## 1. Backend: Fetching Learned Items Data
We need a new Server Action to retrieve the detailed list of learned items, as the current stats only return counts.

- **File**: `actions/srsActions.ts`
- **Action**: Create `getLearnedItemsDetails(planId: string)`
- **Logic**:
  1. Fetch the `Plan` document.
  2. Collect all IDs from `learnedComponentsIds` and `reviewLearnedComponentsIds`.
  3. Query both `learningItems` and `learningStructures` collections to resolve these IDs into actual content (titles/types).
  4. Return a unified list of learned items.

## 2. UI: Making StatCard Interactive
We need to enable click interactions on the dashboard cards.

- **File**: `components/notebook/StatsDashboard.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  1. Update `StatCardProps` to include an optional `onClick: () => void`.
  2. Apply `onClick` and `cursor-pointer` to the `StatCard` container.
  3. Update `StatsDashboard` component to accept `onLearnedClick` prop and pass it to the "Learned" card.

## 3. UI: Creating the Modal Component
We will create a dedicated modal to display the list of learned items, following the project's modal patterns.

- **File**: `components/notebook/LearnedItemsModal.tsx` (New File)
- **Structure**:
  - Use `components/ui/modal.tsx` (Modal, ModalContent, ModalHeader, etc.).
  - Props: `isOpen`, `onClose`, `items`, `loading`.
  - Content: A scrollable list of learned items. Use `NoResults` if the list is empty.

## 4. Integration: Wiring it all together
Finally, we connect the dashboard interaction to the new modal and data fetching logic.

- **File**: `app/[locale]/hub/student/my-notebook/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  1. Add state: `isLearnedModalOpen`, `learnedItems`, `learnedItemsLoading`.
  2. Implement `handleLearnedClick`:
     - Open the modal.
     - Trigger `getLearnedItemsDetails` (if data isn't loaded yet).
     - Update state with the fetched items.
  3. Pass `handleLearnedClick` to `StatsDashboard`.
  4. Render `<LearnedItemsModal />` at the page level.
