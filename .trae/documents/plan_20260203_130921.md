# Implement Resend Usage Dashboard via Headers

Great find! Using the response headers is a clever way to get real-time usage data without complex integrations.

I will proceed with the **Resend-first** approach as requested.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Server-Side Usage Service (`services/admin/resendUsageService.ts`)
Since the standard SDK might abstract away the headers, I will implement a specialized server action that:
-   Makes a direct, safe `fetch` call to the Resend API (e.g., listing domains or a single email).
-   **Crucial Step**: Captures the raw response headers:
    -   `x-resend-daily-quota` (Daily usage)
    -   `x-resend-monthly-quota` (Monthly usage)
-   Returns these values to the frontend.

### 2. Resend Usage Component (`components/admin/ResendUsageWidget.tsx`)
Create a dedicated widget that displays:
-   **Daily Quota**: Progress bar showing used vs. limit (if header provides limit) or just "Used: X".
-   **Monthly Quota**: Progress bar for monthly usage.
-   **Status**: Connection health.

### 3. Dashboard Integration
-   Add this new widget to `app/[locale]/hub/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`.
-   This validates the pattern before we expand to other services (Stream, etc.).

### 4. Verification
-   I will verify if the headers are returned on "List" requests (like listing domains) so we don't need to send an actual email to check the quota.

I will start by creating the service and the component.
