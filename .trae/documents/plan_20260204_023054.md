I will modify the student's podcast experience to allow listening directly from the list page without navigation, using a floating player with collapsible transcription.

### **Implementation Plan**

1.  **Create `FloatingPodcastPlayer` Component**
    -   **Location**: `components/immersion/FloatingPodcastPlayer.tsx`
    -   **Features**:
        -   **Floating UI**: A fixed player (bottom of screen) styled similar to the reference photo (dark theme, glassmorphism).
        -   **Controls**: Play/Pause, Seek, Volume (reusing `usePodcastPlayer` logic).
        -   **Collapsible Transcription**: An expandable section within the player to read along.
        -   **Full Page Link**: A button in the top-right corner to navigate to the dedicated podcast page (`/hub/student/my-immersion/podcasts/[id]`).
        -   **Close Button**: To dismiss the player.
    -   **Tech**: Uses `framer-motion` for smooth expand/collapse animations (if available, otherwise CSS transitions).

2.  **Create `PodcastListClient` Component**
    -   **Location**: `components/immersion/PodcastListClient.tsx`
    -   **Purpose**: A Client Component to handle the interactivity of the podcast list.
    -   **Logic**:
        -   Manages `activePodcast` state.
        -   Renders the grid of podcast cards.
        -   On click: Instead of navigating, it sets the `activePodcast`, triggering the `FloatingPodcastPlayer` to appear.

3.  **Update Student Podcasts Page**
    -   **Location**: `app/[locale]/hub/student/my-immersion/podcasts/page.tsx`
    -   **Change**: Replace the direct rendering of the grid with the new `PodcastListClient`, passing the server-fetched podcasts as props.

### **User Experience Flow**
1.  Student visits "My Immersion > Podcasts".
2.  Clicks on a podcast card.
3.  **No navigation happens.** Instead, the **Floating Player** appears at the bottom.
4.  Student can listen, expand the transcription to read, or click the "Full Page" icon to go to the dedicated page if they prefer.
