I will modify the authentication flow to automatically sync the Google profile picture with the user's account in Firestore.

**Proposed Implementation:**

1. **Update NextAuth Logic (`app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`)**:

   * In the `signIn` callback: When a user logs in with Google, the system will check if their Firestore profile already has an `avatarUrl`.

   * **Logic**:

     * If `avatarUrl` is **missing** (empty/null) AND the Google profile provides a picture:

     * The system will automatically update the user's Firestore document with the Google picture URL.

   * **Result**: The user will immediately see their Google photo after the first login.

2. **Handling Manual Uploads**:

   * **Question**: "What happens when they upload a photo?"

   * **Answer**: The system uses a single field (`avatarUrl`) in the database.

     * **Scenario A (First Login)**: System saves Google Photo → `avatarUrl`.

     * **Scenario B (User Uploads Photo)**: The upload overwrites `avatarUrl`.
