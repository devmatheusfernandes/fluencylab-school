I will implement the requested mobile design changes by moving the Notebooks and Tasks interaction into a mobile-only Drawer system, triggered by icons injected into the Breadcrumb.

### 1. Prepare the Breadcrumb for Injected Actions

**File:** `components/shared/Breadcrum/Breadcrum.tsx`

* Add a container `<div id="breadcrumb-mobile-actions" />` inside the Breadcrumb navigation bar, specifically in the right-aligned section next to the ThemeSwitcher.

* This container will serve as a **Portal Target** for page-specific actions.

### 2. Create a Portal Helper

**File:** `components/shared/Breadcrum/BreadcrumbActions.tsx` (New File)

* Create a reusable `BreadcrumbActions` component that uses `React.createPortal` to render its children into the `#breadcrumb-mobile-actions` div.

* This allows the `my-notebook` page (and future pages) to dynamically inject icons into the global Breadcrumb layout.

### 3. Create Mobile-Optimized Drawer Content

I will create two new components specifically designed for the Drawer UI, as requested, to ensure a clean mobile experience without just reusing the desktop cards.

**File:** `components/student/MobileNotebooksList.tsx` (New File)

* A simplified, list-based version of `NotebooksCard`.

* **Features:** Search bar, list of notebooks with title/date, navigation via `Link`.

* **Props:** `notebooks`, `student`, `userRole`.

**File:** `components/student/MobileTasksList.tsx` (New File)

* A simplified, list-based version of `TasksCard`.

* **Features:** List of tasks with checkboxes, add task input (if applicable), delete options.

* **Props:** `tasks`, `onUpdateTask`, `onAddTask`, `onDeleteTask`.

### 4. Implement Logic in My Notebook Page

**File:** `app/[locale]/hub/student/my-notebook/page.tsx`

* **State:** Add `isNotebooksOpen` and `isTasksOpen` states.

* **Portal:** Use `<BreadcrumbActions>` to render:

  * A `Book` icon (triggers Notebooks Drawer).

  * A `CheckSquare` icon (triggers Tasks Drawer).

* **Drawers:** Implement two `Drawer` components (`components/ui/drawer.tsx`):

  * **Notebooks Drawer:** Renders `MobileNotebooksList`.

  * **Tasks Drawer:** Renders `MobileTasksList`.

* **Responsive Visibility:**

  * Apply `hidden md:block` to the existing `NotebooksCard` and `TasksCard` to hide them on mobile.

  * The Portal icons will be visible only on mobile (controlled by CSS classes in the Portal target).

### 5. Verification

* Verify that icons appear in the Breadcrumb on mobile.

* Verify that clicking icons opens the respective Drawers.

* Verify that Drawers display the correct data and interactions work (navigation, task completion).

* Verify that desktop view remains unchanged.
