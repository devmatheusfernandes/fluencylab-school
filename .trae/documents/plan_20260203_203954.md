I will implement a notification system that alerts enrolled students whenever a lesson or section is created or updated, without sending push notifications as requested.

### 1. Update Services
- **AnnouncementService**:
  - Modify `createAnnouncement` and `createSystemAnnouncement` to accept an optional `skipPush` parameter.
  - This allows creating persistent database notifications (visible in the app) without triggering the external Push Notification service.
- **CourseService**:
  - Add a `getEnrolledStudentIds(courseId: string)` method.
  - This method will efficiently query Firestore using a Collection Group Query on `enrollments` to find all students enrolled in a specific course.

### 2. Integrate Notifications into API Routes
I will inject the notification logic directly into the server-side API routes that handle course content updates. This ensures notifications are sent regardless of which UI page triggers the action.

- **POST /api/admin/courses/[courseId]/sections** (Create Section):
  - After successfully creating a section, fetch enrolled students.
  - Create a system announcement: "Nova Seção: [Title]" with `skipPush: true`.
- **POST .../lessons** (Create Lesson):
  - After successfully creating a lesson, fetch enrolled students.
  - Create a system announcement: "Nova Lição: [Title]" with `skipPush: true`.
- **PUT .../lessons/[lessonId]** (Update Lesson):
  - After successfully updating a lesson, fetch enrolled students.
  - Create a system announcement: "Lição Atualizada: [Title]" with `skipPush: true`.

This approach ensures all enrolled students receive "normal notifications" in their notification center (handled by `useNotifications.ts`) whenever content changes, fulfilling the requirement to avoid push notifications.
