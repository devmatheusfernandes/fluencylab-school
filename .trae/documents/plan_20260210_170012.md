I will implement the **"IRPF Devido"** card in the MEI Fiscal Dashboard to display the estimated tax liability based on the taxable profit.

### 1. Calculation Logic
I will implement a utility function to calculate the IRPF based on the **2024 Monthly Table** (since the user mentioned "Base mensal" in the example, but context implies annual projection, I will clarify/use the **Annualized Monthly Table** or a standard annual projection logic).

Given the user's example:
*   **Monthly Exemption Limit**: R$ 2.259,20
*   **Annual Exemption Limit** (approx): R$ 2.259,20 * 12 = **R$ 27.110,40** (plus any simplified discount if applicable, but we'll stick to the standard progressive table logic).

**Logic:**
1.  Take the `taxableProfit` (Lucro Tributável) already calculated.
2.  Compare with the **Annualized Exemption Limit** (to be safe and consistent with the "Annual Revenue" view).
    *   *Self-Correction*: Since the dashboard shows "Annual Revenue", the "Taxable Profit" is also annual. Therefore, I should use the **Annual IRPF Table** logic.
    *   **Annual Exemption (approx)**: ~R$ 27.000,00 (Current rules).
3.  If `taxableProfit` <= Exemption Limit -> **IRPF = 0**.
4.  If > Limit -> Apply standard progressive rates (7.5%, 15%, 22.5%, 27.5%) minus the deductible portion.

**Simplification for MVP (as per user request "R$ 200 is below limit"):**
I will implement a `calculateEstimatedIRPF(annualTaxableIncome)` function directly inside the component or a helper file.

### 2. UI Implementation (`hub/admin/finances/fiscal/page.tsx`)
*   Add a **5th Card** to the MEI Metrics Grid.
*   **Title**: "IRPF Estimado" (or "IRPF Devido" as requested).
*   **Value**: Result of the calculation (currency formatted).
*   **Subtitle**:
    *   If 0: "Isento (Abaixo do limite)"
    *   If > 0: "A recolher via DARF/Ajuste"

### 3. Execution Plan
1.  **Modify** `app/[locale]/hub/admin/finances/fiscal/page.tsx`:
    *   Add `irpfDue` state to `meiMetrics`.
    *   Implement the IRPF calculation logic inside the `useEffect` or a separate helper.
    *   Render the new Card.
2.  **Verify**: Ensure R$ 200,00 taxable profit results in R$ 0,00 IRPF.

### IRPF 2024 Annual Table (Reference for implementation)
*   Up to R$ 27.110,40: **Exempt**
*   R$ 27.110,41 to R$ 33.919,80: **7.5%** (Deduct R$ 2.033,28)
*   ...and so on.

*Note: I will use the current standard table values.*
