I have analyzed the structure of both files and found the inconsistency causing issues.

**Analysis:**
*   **`messages/en.json` (Correct):** `StudentProfileSurvey`, `StudentProfileList`, and `AssociateModal` are **siblings** of `LandingPage`. They are at the root level of the JSON object.
*   **`messages/pt.json` (Incorrect):** These three keys appear **twice**:
    1.  **Nested inside** `LandingPage` (Incorrect).
    2.  **At the root level** later in the file (Correct).

**Plan:**
1.  Remove the incorrect nested blocks (`StudentProfileSurvey`, `StudentProfileList`, `AssociateModal`) from inside `LandingPage` in `messages/pt.json`.
2.  This will leave `LandingPage` with only its correct children (`nav`, `heroCard`, etc.) and rely on the correct root-level definitions for the other components.

This cleanup will align the structure of `pt.json` with `en.json` and resolve the duplication/nesting errors.
