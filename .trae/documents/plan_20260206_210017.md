The issue is caused by a logic error in `hooks/teacher/useTeacherAvailabilityForReschedule.ts` that forces all "makeup" slots to be treated as non-repeating, even if they are set to repeat. This causes repeating makeup slots (like the ones on Wednesdays shown in the user's screenshot) to only be considered for their start date (which is likely in the past), effectively hiding all future occurrences except for the single-instance ones (like the one on Saturday 14th).

Plan:

1. **Modify** **`hooks/teacher/useTeacherAvailabilityForReschedule.ts`**:

   * Update the condition `if (slot.type === 'makeup' || !slot.repeating)` to `if (!slot.repeating)`.

   * This will allow repeating makeup slots to properly enter the recurrence loop logic and generate available slots for future dates (e.g., Feb 11, Feb 18).

2. **Verify**:

   * The change ensures that repeating makeup slots are expanded into their individual occurrences, making them visible in the rescheduling modal.

   * Non-repeating makeup slots will still be handled correctly by the `if` block.

   * Regular classes are already filtered out by the API, so they won't appear (as expected).
